# Study hours outside class contact

&gt; “The study hours for each credit point is 10 hours. For a 30-credit module this equates to 300 hours. Therefore, if a module has time-tabled activities i.e. lecture/seminar/lab, of 3 hours per week for a 24-week period (total of 72 hours), then the out-of-class study commitment expected of students is 228 hours in total.” - Course Handbook.

* Practical meanings: 25 days x 2 hours per day x 4 months 14 days = 228 hours

# Master’s degree in UK

&gt; “[A] master’s [degree] is hard work and requires a lot of commitment. It has to be something you actively want to do . . .Postgraduate study is much more independent than undergraduate study, so, on a practical level, it is important to be aware that you may be working by yourself for much of the time.” - [Taking the plunge into the master’s world (The Guardian, 2009)](http://bit.ly/2fBScEa)

# Why do good people do bad things Bud Krogh

&gt; “. . . Watergate was a government meltdown . . . You had people of good intent who were basically honest and wanted to do a good job who came into a world where there was enormous pressure for results. In government, it’s carrying the president’s program forward. In the corporate world, it’s creating shareholder value and profits. Those internal drivers become more important than anything else. It’s very difficult to adhere to your own moral code, especially if you think, Well, this is just the way things are done. It’s the way government runs. It’s the way corporation run.” - Bud Krogh&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Who are honest

* Association of Certified Fraud Examiner Workplace Deviance Model (Results of research into honesty)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

    + No more than 10% of employees (including managers and directors) can be relied upon to be “totally honest”;

    + 10% of the workforce might be described as being “totally dishonest”;

    + 80% is capable of being influenced (to do good or bad);

    + Strong internal controls will have a major deterrent effect on any individual who might be tempted to commit fraud.

# The Fraud Triangle (1951)

&gt; Hypothesis: “Trusted persons become trust violators when they conceive of themselves as having a financial problem which is non-sharable, are aware that this problem can be secretly resolved by violation of the position of financial trust and are able to apply to their own conduct in that situation verbalisations which enable them to adjust their conceptions of themselves as trusted persons with their conceptions of themselves as users of entrusted funds or property.”&lt;sup&gt;1, 2&lt;/sup&gt;

* Interviewed 133 inmates in three prisons for his study&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;;

* Three elements present in every fraud: motivation (some kind of perceived pressure), opportunity ( some perceived opportunity) and rationalisation (some way to rationalise the fraud as not being inconsistent with one’s values.)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

# The Fraud Triangle: Motivation

* Motive (or pressure or incentive)

* Feel a pressure or a need to commit fraud, e.g. financial obligations;

* “fraud pressure” = “perceived non-shareable financial need”.

* “status deflating” = the embarrassment of not being able to fulfil the financial need.

---

# The Fraud Triangle: Opportunity

* An open door for solving a non-shareable problem in secret by violating a trust;

* Concealment;

* Would not get caught;

* Some technical skill and knowledge of the systems and controls within an organisation;

* Directors and managers represent a high fraud risk is because their rank in hierarchical organisations often gives them the ability to override controls.

---

# Rationalisation: morally acceptable rationalisation

* Before the crime takes place

* Convince himself or herself that the actions they are about to take are not really criminal at all

* A conscious decision by the perpetrator to place his or her needs above the needs of others;

* Preserving his or her self-image as a trustworthy person;

* Some common rationalisations (the act is justified): . . . ;

---

# Some common rationalisations:

* Even up the scorecard;

* Promotion that was not forthcoming;

* Pay rise inadequate;

* No expected bonus;

* Just a loan;

* Company does not need money;

* Part of general scheme in which they are not completely culpable;

# Interaction of the three key variables as a balance scale

&gt; “We found that the decision to commit fraud is determined by the interaction of all three forces. We concluded that a useful way to visualize the interaction is to picture a balance scale (see Figure 2, “Fraud: Three Key Variables” at right) with three connecting bars at the top. Each of the three connected bars has a weight that can move independently of the other weights, in either direction. Thus, the combination of the three continua (or bars) - along with the locations and sizes of the three weights - determines to which side the scale will tilt.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

    + The fraudster’s department 

---

# The greatest risk lies at the top

* They are the individuals with the greatest opportunity to commit fraud by overriding controls

* They are likely to have the ability to conceal the fraud too

* Biggest fraud losses tend to result from the actions of well-educated, older males

---

# Tenure

* Those working for a longer period of time tend to generate more trust from their managers and peers

* They can develop a good understanding of the systems and procedures, being in a position to spot weakness and evade internal controls

* They may reach higher levels of authority

---

# The squeezed middle

* The typical internal fraudster in the UK is a male middle manager in his thirties who has been employed by the victim organisation for between three and five years

* Middle managers remain longer at that level because of poor economy

* The middle manager (highly-skilled technical) perceives that his or her superior has an inadequate grasp of the technical detail

---

# The fraudster’s department

* Accounting, operations, sales, customer service, purchasing and executive / upper management

* Working on the trading desks of financial services institutions

* The executive suite (board and senior management level) as one of the high-risk departments

# Enron Corp. (Enron)

* A failure of corporate governance: A wake-up call

&gt; “The Enron Board of Directors failed to safeguard Enron shareholders and contributed to the collapse of the seventh largest public company in the United States, by allowing Enron to engage in high risk accounting, inappropriate conflict of interest transactions, extensive undisclosed off-the-books activities, and excessive executive compensation. The Board witnessed numerous indications of questionable practices by Enron management over several years, but chose to ignore them to the detriment of Enron shareholders, employees and business associates.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Malpractices of Enron explained

* In September 2016, a HK company (A) agreed to sell goods to a British company (B) for £1 million. A agreed to deliver and B agreed to pay in £ in April 2017. For simplicity, let us assume “selling price” = “profit” + “material and labour costs”. Let us also assume A paid its “material and labour costs” in HK in HK$.

* In September 2016, £1 equalled HK$9.8. The contract was worth HK$9.8 million.

* If the HK dollar falls to $9.2 per £ by April 2017, the £1 million will only worth HK$9.2 million to A. How can A avoid the risk of potential loss?

---

# Malpractices of Enron explained


* In September 2016, A entered into a contract on the £ with his HK bank. The contract binds A to sell £ 1 million to the bank and the bank to buy £1 million at an exchange rate of £ 1 to HK$9.8 in April 2017.

* The contract is called a derivatives contract. The value of the contract is “derived” from the underlying value of the sales and purchase contract.

* The derivatives contract protects against A’s potential loss. What if £1 equals to HK$11 in April 2017?

* What if £1 equals to HK$8.8 in April 2017?

---

# Malpractices of Enron explained

* Where A agreed to deliver and B agreed to pay in 2019, if in 2017 or 2018, A’s accountant is to give an account for the profit (why not loss), how would he do it?

* Similarly, where D and E entered into a contract that would give D a lot of earnings in the years to come, if A which owned 97% of D, raised a large sum of money from a bank F in exchange for a promise of most of the earnings from the contract of D, how would A’s account record the receipt of the large sum of money? What if the contract of D and E resulted in a loss? What if E cancelled the contract a year later?

# Introduction: Money Laundering

&gt; “Money laundering can be defined as the process utilised by criminals to disguise or convert the proceeds of crime (dirty money) into clean money. In this sense, the term ‘criminal’ can include drug dealers, burglars, fraudsters, people traffickers, smugglers, terrorists, extortionists, tax evaders and illegal arm dealers, but can also include lawyers, accountants, financial experts and many other intermediaries.” (why ‘wash’ the money?)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

* A single primary offence of fraud, contained in section 1 of the Fraud Act 2006.

* The offence can be committed in 3 different ways:

    + by a false representation (section 2);

    + by a failure to disclose information when there is a legal duty to do so (section 3);
  
    + by abuse of a position (section 4).

&gt; “A person may have reasonable grounds to suspect that property is one thing (A) when in fact it is something different (B). But that is not so when the question is what a person knows. A person cannot know that something is (A) when in fact it is (B). The proposition that a person knows that something is (A) is based on the premise that it is true that it is (A). The fact that the property is (A) provides the starting point. Then there is the question whether the person knows that the property is (A).” - [R v Montila (Steven William) (2004) 1 WLR 3141](http://bit.ly/2dVPAxE)

# Defendant knows the representation is “misleading or untrue”

&gt; The proposition that a person (defendant) knows that something (the representation) is (A) (“misleading or untrue”) is based on the premise that it is true that it (the representation) is (A) (“misleading or untrue”). So, it is necessary to prove that the representation is misleading or untrue.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Dishonesty: 

* R v Ghosh [1982] 1 QB 1053

&gt; “. . . a jury must first of all decide whether according to the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people what was done was dishonest. If it was not dishonest by those standards, that is the end of the matter and the prosecution fails. If, however, it was dishonest by those standards, then the jury must consider whether the defendant himself must have realised that what he was doing was by those standards dishonest. ”

* 25 October 2017

&gt; However, the second leg of the rule adopted in Ghosh has serious problems. The principal objection is that the less a defendant’s standards conform to society’s expectations, the less likely they are to be held criminally responsible for their behaviour. The law should not excuse those who make a mistake about contemporary standards of honesty, a purpose of the criminal law is to set acceptable standards of behaviour.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;

* 25 October 2017

&gt; In civil actions the law has settled on an objective test of dishonesty. There can be no logical or principled basis for the meaning of dishonesty to differ according to whether it arises in a civil action or a criminal prosecution. The second leg of the test propounded in Ghosh does not correctly represent the law and directions based upon it ought no longer to be given. The test of dishonesty is that used in civil actions. The fact-finding tribunal must ascertain (subjectively) the actual state of the individual’s knowledge or belief as to the facts and then determine whether his conduct was honest or dishonest by the (objective) standards of ordinary decent people. There is no requirement that the defendant must appreciate that what he has done is, by those standards, dishonest.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;

# Fraud by failing to disclose information (section 3)

* Extent and nature of legal duty

&gt; “Section 3 makes it an offence to commit fraud by failing to disclose information to another person where there is a legal duty to disclose the information. A legal duty to disclose information may include duties under oral contracts as well as written contracts. The concept of “legal duty” is explained in the Law Commission’s Report on Fraud, which said at paragraphs 7.28 and 7.29:”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Such a duty may derive from statute (such as the provisions governing company prospectuses), from the fact that the transaction in question is one of the utmost good faith (such as a contract of insurance), from the express or implied terms of a contract, from the custom of a particular trade or market, or from the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the parties (such as that of agent and principal).”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Extent and nature of legal duty

&gt; “7.29. For this purpose there is a legal duty to disclose information not only if the defendant’s failure to disclose it gives the victim a cause of action for damages, but also if the law gives the victim a right to set aside any change in his or her legal position to which he or she may consent as a result of the non-disclosure. For example, a person in a fiduciary position has a duty to disclose material information when entering into a contract with his or her beneficiary, in the sense that a failure to make such disclosure will entitle the beneficiary to rescind the contract and to reclaim any property transferred under it.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

# Policy background Policy background

* The UK Government’s policy on the reform of the criminal law of fraud is largely based on the Law Commission’s Report on Fraud (Law Com No. 276, Cm 5560, 2002).

* In 2006, fraud became a major policy goal of the UK Government.

* The Fraud Review concluded that the government has two functions:

    + to protect public money from fraudsters; and
  
    + to protect customers and businesses against fraud.

---

# The Fraud Review

* The Fraud Review recommended creation of:

    + The National Fraud Authority to develop and implement the government strategy;

    + The National Fraud Reporting Centre so that businesses and individuals could report fraud (This resulted in the creation of the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau).

    + a national lead police authority based on the City of London Police.

# Objectives of the National Fraud Authority

* To create a criminal justice system that is sympathetic to the needs of the victims of fraud by ensuring that the system operates more effectively and efficiently;

* To attempt to discourage organised criminals from committing fraud in the UK; and

* To increase the public’s confidence in the response to fraud

&gt; “we are not a general fraud prosecutor. We have specific powers to prosecute particular offences, and I am sure that you will be aware that we have spent quite a lot of time and energy on prosecuting both section 397 offences and indeed insider dealing offences in recent years. What we do not have is a remit to prosecute false accounting, conspiracy and so on in a general sense. We could prosecute it as ancillary to one of our main offences, so if there was a markets offence, you could throw in money laundering as well, but our investigative powers are limited to the offences that we have the ability to prosecute.” [Tracey McDermott of FSA, paragraph 200](http://bit.ly/2e1JH6I)

# Power of FSA


Tracey McDermott of FSA

&gt; “Tracey McDermott subsequently confirmed that the FSA was also able to prosecute non-financial market offences in its capacity as a private prosecutor. This is consistent with the ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of R v Rollins in 2010. However, when asked whether there was enough evidence of fraudulent conduct to commence a criminal prosecution in this case, Tracy McDermott responded that “[this] is not our specialist area of expertise. It is not where our fees are raised to prosecute, that is to focus on the FSMA offences”.”  [Tracey McDermott of FSA, paragraph 201](http://bit.ly/2e1JH6I)

# Modern internal controls frameworks

* The Turnbull Guidance: four stage framework

    +  Stage 1. Identify and assess risks by looking at aspects such as completeness of risks assessed, the impact and probability of a risk materialising together with time frames;

    + Stage 2. Design appropriate controls over the risks. Controls should be embedded in systems, should include both preventative and detective measures and be cost-effective and proportionate;

    + Stage 3. Test that the controls are working. Here the aim is to be able to state positively that the controls are operating in practice in accordance with their design; and

    + Stage 4. Conclude on the effectiveness of the internal control system. This should be carried out annually by the board, as stipulated in the framework.
